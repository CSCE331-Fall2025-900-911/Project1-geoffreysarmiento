  <p class = "about-me">
    Hello! My name is Geoffrey Sarmiento and I am a Junior Computer Enginering major. My interests in computer science gear more toward using software to get physical results.
    Things like using software to program the controls of a machine or the function of an embedded system. The idea of using digital data and getting real world results 
    is very exciting to me. Coding is an enjoyable experience as it is, but having a pay off to the coding that you can physically see is a different feeling
    altogether. 
    <br><br>
    In the future I hope to be able to work with both hardware and software in order to create things that have a positive impact on the world. An example of a project
    I find interesting is the use of computer vision and machine learning to improve medical imaging analysis. Software is implemented to improve imaging tools
    and make radiologists' jobs easier leading to increased accuracy. I also have an interest in animals so a project like anti-poaching/deforestation systems 
    is also enticing to me. Using articial intelligence, GPS, and high powered cameras via satellite, conservationists are attempting to crack down poaching 
    and deforestation to sooner alert authorities. Projects like these that make a difference in the world interest me greatly because the feeling that 
    you are actively improving someone's life through your work is amazing.
    <br><br>
    Outside the field of computer science, my hobbies include going to the gym, playing video games, and building stuff like keyboards and PCs. 
    Some of my interests include stuff involving true crime, random facts about TV shows, and, as I mentioned above, animals. Make sure to check out the rest
    of my website in order to get to know me even more! Sections of my website are accessible through the navigation bar and by scrolling down this page.
