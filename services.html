    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li style=" margin-left:33.5%; font-size:20px; max-width: 500px; text-align: center;">The Texas A&M Computing Society aims to build a community for those interested in computing and the field of computer science.
            The organization also hosts events that give back to the community. The best example of this is the Build4Good hackathon. The Build4Good hackathon
            challenges participants to create a program in a category of their choice that improves the community in some way. I have parcipated before and 
            created a <a href="portfolio.html">machine learning model</a> that predicts CO2 trends using public data.
